Twitch Purple Scroll Bar.

Honestly, made this as it surprised me that Twitch didn't offer this unique visual change, it adds quite a lot to the experience if you use the dark theme as it is not optimised for the white/light version.

Once you get used to it, it's hard to go back to the standard version.

The theme applies only to [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/).
